/** Specifies how a Feature is displayed in the list view. 
 
 Possible values are:

 - *check* (default) - The Feature's visibility is tied to its item's checkbox.
 - *radioFolder* - When specified for a Container, only one of the Container's items is visible at a time
 - *checkOffOnly* - When specified for a Container or Network Link, prevents all items from being made visible at onceâ€”that is, the user can turn everything in the Container or Network Link off but cannot turn everything on at the same time. This setting is useful for Containers or Network Links containing large amounts of data.
 - *checkHideChildren* - Use a normal checkbox for visibility but do not display the Container or Network Link's children in the list view. A checkbox allows the user to toggle visibility of the child objects in the viewer.

/** Background color for the Snippet. 
 
 Color and opacity values are expressed in hexadecimal notation. 
 The range of values for any one color is 0 to 255 (00 to ff). 
 For alpha, 00 is fully transparent and ff is fully opaque. 
 The order of expression is aabbggrr, where aa=alpha (00 to ff); bb=blue (00 to ff); gg=green (00 to ff); rr=red (00 to ff). 
 For example, if you want to apply a blue color with 50 percent opacity to an overlay, you would specify the following: &lt;color&gt;7fff0000&lt;/color&gt;, where alpha=0x7f, blue=0xff, green=0x00, and red=0x00. */
